**Beehive-AI-System** uses sensor data and Generative AI to monitor beehive activity and health. It provides beekeepers with intelligent alerts to simplify management and improve colony well-being.

The system analyzes sensor data like temperature, humidity, weight, and sound to detect potential issues and proactively notify beekeepers.

This project aims to make beekeeping more efficient and data-driven.
